REQUIREMENT DETAILS:

User Story Description:
As a Policy Center user with the Respective Permission added, I want to enter a custom cancellation Refund amount during policy cancellation transaction
So that I can override the system-generated cancellation amount and apply the correct premium adjustment without needing a separate transaction.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the user enters a custom cancellation refund amount in the dedicated field
When the cancellation is submitted
Then the system should use the user-entered refund amount to process the Cancellation

Given the user has not entered a custom cancellation refund amount
When the cancellation is submitted
Then the system should use the system-generated cancellation Refund amount by default

Given the cancellation is processed using a user-entered amount
When the Reinstatement is submitted
Then the system should use the user-entered refund amount to process the Reinstatement

Given the user overriding the Cancellation refund amount
When they enter a new amount manually more than system generated amount
Then user should be able to get the validation message (VAL-568)

Note to QA:

We don't have Smartcomm Impact on this US. Please make sure to add a test scenario to check the Cancellation Letter is generated with the right Refund
Make sure to test the Policy change and cancellation transactions scenarios after reinstatement.
